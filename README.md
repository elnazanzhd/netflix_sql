## üìä Dataset
**Source:** [Netflix Movies and TV Shows on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows/versions/5?resource=download)  

## üìÅ Project Overview

This project demonstrates SQL-based analysis of a Netflix dataset using PostgreSQL. The SQL queries are crafted to answer real-world business questions and uncover hidden patterns in content type, release trends, viewer preferences, and creative collaborations.

All queries are stored in a single SQL file:

```bash
solutions.sql
```

## üß± Table Schema

The dataset is stored in one table: `netflix`. Below is the schema used:

| Column | Data Type | Description |
|---------------|---------------|----------------------------------------|
| `show_id` | `VARCHAR(10)` | Unique ID for each show |
| `kind` | `VARCHAR(10)` | Type of content: 'Movie' or 'TV Show' |
| `title` | `VARCHAR(150)`| Title of the content |
| `director` | `VARCHAR(220)`| Director(s) of the content |
| `performers` | `VARCHAR(1000)`| List of cast members |
| `country` | `VARCHAR(150)`| Country where the content was produced |
| `date_added` | `VARCHAR(50)` | Date added to Netflix |
| `release_year`| `INT` | Year the content was released |
| `rating` | `VARCHAR(12)` | Maturity rating |
| `duration` | `VARCHAR(20)` | Length of the content (minutes/seasons)|
| `listed_in` | `VARCHAR(100)`| Genres/categories |

## üõ†Ô∏è Key SQL Techniques Used

- **Aggregate Functions**: `COUNT()`, `GROUP BY`
- **Window Functions**: `RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY ...)`
- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**: For modular, readable subqueries
- **String Functions**: `SUBSTRING`, `STRING_TO_ARRAY`, `TRIM`, `UNNEST`
- **Filtering**: `WHERE`, `LIKE`, `IS NOT NULL`, Regex-based conditions
- **Sorting & Limiting**: `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`



## How to Run

1. Load your dataset into a PostgreSQL-compatible database.
2. Create the `netflix` table using the schema provided.
3. Run the queries from `solutions.sql`.
4. Analyze or visualize the results using your preferred BI tool or SQL client.
